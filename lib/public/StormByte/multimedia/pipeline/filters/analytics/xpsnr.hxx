	/**
	 * @class XPSNR
	 * @brief Full-reference XPSNR (activity-weighted PSNR). Analytics leaf.
	 *
	 * @par What an Analytics leaf is
	 * Analytics is not on the encode path. @ref Process sees
	 * only @ref Pipeline::Frame. Reference
	 * @ref Item::Producer is @ref Producer::Decoder.
	 * Distorted Producer is @ref Producer::Encoder or
	 * @ref Producer::Remuxer. There is no Packet and no
	 * @ref FFmpeg::Save.
	 *
	 * Implement @ref Setup, @ref Process, @ref Eof, @ref Clean,
	 * @ref Report, @ref Media.
	 *
	 * @par Pairing
	 * Presentation FIFOs per @ref Pipeline::Frame::Track, not Serial
	 * or PTS. Each look leaves avcodec in presentation order, so
	 * the nth Decoder tap frame of a track is the same picture as
	 * the nth dest-look frame of that track. There is no pooled
	 * mean across tracks.
	 *
	 * @par Metric
	 * Block MSE weighted by a simple spatial-activity map on the
	 * reference (sum of absolute 1-pixel gradients in 16×16
	 * blocks). High-detail blocks dominate; flat areas do not
	 * inflate the score. Peak is @c (1 << bpc) - 1. Every plane
	 * the layout exposes is scored. @ref Report publishes
	 * @c xpsnr_y / @c xpsnr_u / @c xpsnr_v when that plane exists,
	 * plus @c xpsnr_mean and @c xpsnr_min. Identical frames
	 * report a finite cap of 100.0, not +inf.
	 *
	 * This is the same *class* of metric as avfilter `xpsnr`,
	 * implemented on
	 * @ref StormByte::Multimedia::FFmpeg::AVFrame only
	 * (@c Data, @c Linesize, @c PlaneWidth, @c PlaneHeight,
	 * @c BitsPerComponent, @c Clone, @c ScaleTo). No libav
	 * headers and no avfilter.
	 *
	 * @par Geometry
	 * Latched on the first valid reference. Distorted looks
	 * of another size are scaled to that latch with
	 * @ref AVFrame::ScaleTo. A later reference that changes
	 * width/height is skipped with a Warning. Scale is not
	 * @ref Report::Failed.
	 *
	 * @par Memory
	 * Process clones the RAII look, parks it, scores when both
	 * FIFOs have a head, and returns. Leftovers are only warned
	 * in @ref Eof. @ref InputCeiling (512) sizes the analytics
	 * hopper, not the park.
	 *
	 * @par When to read @ref Report
	 * Wait until the job is Done. A low score is not Fail.
	 * @ref Report::Failed only when no pair was scored. One
	 * track keeps flat keys (`xpsnr_mean`). Several tracks
	 * prefix with the origin index (`0.xpsnr_mean`).
	 *
	 * @see StormByte::Multimedia::Pipeline::Filter::Analytics
	 * @see StormByte::Multimedia::Pipeline::Filter::Video::PSNR
