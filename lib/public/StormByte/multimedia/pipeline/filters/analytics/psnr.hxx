	/**
	 * @class PSNR
	 * @brief Full-reference PSNR. Analytics leaf.
	 *
	 * @par What an Analytics leaf is
	 * Analytics is not on the encode path. @ref Process sees
	 * only @ref Pipeline::Frame. Reference
	 * @ref Item::Producer is @ref Producer::Decoder.
	 * Distorted Producer is @ref Producer::Encoder or
	 * @ref Producer::Remuxer. There is no Packet and no
	 * @ref FFmpeg::Save.
	 *
	 * Implement @ref Setup, @ref Process, @ref Eof, @ref Clean,
	 * @ref Report, @ref Media.
	 *
	 * @par Pairing
	 * Presentation FIFOs per @ref Pipeline::Frame::Track, not Serial
	 * or PTS. Serial is tube lineage and does not identify a
	 * reconstructed picture when the encoder has delay. Each look
	 * leaves avcodec in presentation order, so the nth Decoder tap
	 * frame of a track is the same picture as the nth dest-look
	 * frame of that track. There is no pooled mean across tracks.
	 *
	 * @par Metric
	 * Peak is @c (1 << bpc) - 1 from the latched reference.
	 * Each scored pair accumulates MSE on every plane the layout
	 * exposes (Y, or Y/U/V). @ref Report publishes
	 * @c psnr_y / @c psnr_u / @c psnr_v when that plane exists,
	 * plus @c psnr_mean (sample-weighted over scored planes)
	 * and @c psnr_min (minimum per-frame average). Identical
	 * frames report a finite cap of 100.0, not +inf.
	 *
	 * Computation uses only
	 * @ref StormByte::Multimedia::FFmpeg::AVFrame
	 * (@c Data, @c Linesize, @c PlaneWidth, @c PlaneHeight,
	 * @c BitsPerComponent, @c Clone, @c ScaleTo). No libav
	 * headers and no avfilter `psnr`.
	 *
	 * @par Geometry
	 * Latched on the first valid reference. Distorted looks
	 * of another size are scaled to that latch with
	 * @ref AVFrame::ScaleTo. A later reference that changes
	 * width/height is skipped with a Warning. Scale is not
	 * @ref Report::Failed.
	 *
	 * @par Memory
	 * Process must not stall the encode tube: it clones the
	 * RAII look, parks it, scores when both FIFOs have a
	 * head, and returns. Waiting for leftovers is only in
	 * @ref Eof. @ref InputCeiling (512) sizes the analytics
	 * hopper, not the park.
	 *
	 * @par When to read @ref Report
	 * Muxer closed is not Eof on this node. Wait until the
	 * job is Done. A low score is not Fail. @ref Report::Failed
	 * only when no pair was scored. One track keeps flat keys
	 * (`psnr_mean`). Several tracks prefix with the origin
	 * index (`0.psnr_mean`, `1.psnr_mean`).
	 *
	 * @see StormByte::Multimedia::Pipeline::Filter::Analytics
	 * @see StormByte::Multimedia::Pipeline::Filter::Video::VMAF
