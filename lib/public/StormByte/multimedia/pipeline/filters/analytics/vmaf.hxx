	/**
	 * @class VMAF
	 * @brief Full-reference VMAF. Reference Analytics leaf.
	 *
	 * @par What an Analytics leaf is
	 * Analytics is not on the encode path. @ref Process sees
	 * only @ref Pipeline::Frame. Reference
	 * @ref Item::Producer is @ref Producer::Decoder.
	 * Distorted Producer is @ref Producer::Encoder or
	 * @ref Producer::Remuxer. There is no Packet and no
	 * @ref FFmpeg::Save.
	 *
	 * Implement @ref Setup, @ref Process, @ref Eof, @ref Clean,
	 * @ref Report, @ref Media.
	 *
	 * @par Pairing
	 * Presentation FIFOs per @ref Pipeline::Frame::Track, not Serial
	 * or PTS. Serial is tube lineage and does not identify a
	 * reconstructed picture when the encoder has delay. Each look
	 * leaves avcodec in presentation order, so the nth Decoder tap
	 * frame of a track is the same picture as the nth dest-look
	 * frame of that track. One libvmaf context per track. There is
	 * no pooled mean across tracks.
	 *
	 * @par Geometry
	 * Latched on the first valid reference. Distorted looks
	 * of another size are scaled to that latch. A later
	 * reference that changes width/height is skipped with a
	 * Warning. Scale is not @ref Report::Failed.
	 *
	 * @par Memory
	 * Process must not stall the encode tube: it clones the
	 * RAII look, enqueues @c vmaf_read_pictures, and returns.
	 * Waiting for extractors is only in @ref Eof.
	 * @ref InputCeiling (512) sizes the analytics hopper, not
	 * the park. Parked RAII frames cover encoder delay (ref
	 * waiting for dist). libvmaf feature extractors scale
	 * with n_threads × resolution, not duration.
	 * Default n_threads is
	 * @c std::thread::hardware_concurrency() (all cores).
	 * 4K 10-bit (`vmaf_4k_v0.6.1`, subsample 1) at 32
	 * threads holds ~18.5 GiB for the extractors (massif
	 * plateau; peak ~20.5 GiB at init). RSS is the same
	 * order. A second video track opens another context of
	 * that size. Pass a smaller thread count in the
	 * constructor to cap it. Park depth is LowLevel; the
	 * module logger throttles it.
	 *
	 * A failed @c vmaf_read_pictures still belongs to us:
	 * Score unrefs both pictures.
	 *
	 * @par When to read @ref Report
	 * Muxer closed is not Eof on this node. Wait until the
	 * job is Done. A low score is not Fail. @ref Report::Failed
	 * only when a context or model could not be opened, or
	 * no pair was scored. One track keeps flat keys
	 * (`vmaf_mean`). Several tracks prefix with the origin
	 * index (`0.vmaf_mean`, `1.vmaf_mean`).
	 *
	 * @see StormByte::Multimedia::Pipeline::Filter::Analytics
