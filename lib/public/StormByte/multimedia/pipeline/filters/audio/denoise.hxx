	 * @par What it is for
	 * Phone / cheap-mic recordings: the constant floor (preamp
	 * hiss, A/C, room tone). Not a neighbour, a slammed door
	 * or a click — those are events. Clicks are @ref Adeclick.
	 * Generic one-pass hiss without a profile is @ref Afftdn.
	 *
	 * @par Measure
	 * Mix-down windows (~350 ms). Keep candidates that look
	 * like floor (not digital mute, not speech, not a transient).
	 * Each candidate has RMS + crest + ZCR + high-pass ratio.
	 * The winner is the signature with the **most neighbours**
	 * inside a distance ball (the repeated room tone), not
	 * the quietest window.
	 *
	 * @par If unsure
	 * Too few candidates, no cluster, or an unstable floor:
	 * Warning and Process is a no-op (no Save). Never subtract
	 * “whatever was left”.
	 *
	 * @par Process
	 * @c afftdn=nr=:nf= from the winner. @c tn off. Conservative
	 * @c nr (12 dB, or caller).
	 *
	 * @par Do not stack
	 * Denoise **or** Afftdn, not both. Hardware N/A.
