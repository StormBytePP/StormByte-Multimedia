	 * Stop inter-sample / digital overs before the encode.
	 * A ceiling, not a loudness match — that is @ref Loudnorm.
	 * Put it last on the audio stretch, or after Loudnorm if
	 * a second safety rail is wanted. It does not compress
	 * LRA and does not change layout or rate.
	 *
	 * @par Do not stack
	 * One Limiter. FFmpeg’s `alimiter` auto-level is **off**
	 * (`level=0`): makeup to 0 dBFS is not this leaf.
	 *
	 * @par Algorithm
	 * @c alimiter=limit=&lt;linear&gt;:level=0:latency=1.
	 * Empty ceiling is −1.5 dBTP (same default as Loudnorm).
	 * `limit` is 10^(dB/20), clamped to 0.0625–1. Lookahead
	 * delay is compensated (`latency=1`). Hardware N/A.
	 *
	 * @par Mutation
	 * @ref Filter::FFmpeg::Save of the abuffersink frame.
	 * EAGAIN = wait. @ref Eof flushes the lookahead.
