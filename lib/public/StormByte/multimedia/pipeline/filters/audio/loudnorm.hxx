	 * @par Measure
	 * One ebur128 state for the whole layout (L/R/C/LFE/Ls/Rs map).
	 * Integrated loudness and LRA are **program** values (BS.1770).
	 * True peak is stored **per channel**. LFE is @c EBUR128_UNUSED
	 * in the loudness sum; it still counts for TP.
	 * Channels are never normalized independently.
	 *
	 * @par Process
	 * Linear gain is always @c I_target − I_measured, same on every
	 * channel. If that gain would push any channel over @p truePeak,
	 * a linked ceiling at @p truePeak runs on the gained samples.
	 * The program gain is not reduced. This is not FFmpeg Dynamic
	 * (no LRA compressor). Same @ref Process as a one-pass leaf
	 * after measure has closed.
	 *
	 * @par Defaults
	 * - I = −23 LUFS (EBU R128)
