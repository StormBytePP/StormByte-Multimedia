	 * @par What it is for
	 * Source narrower than the delivery (stereo→5.1,
	 * 5.1→7.1). Best-effort surround, especially LFE:
	 * `surround` extracts a low band when the target has
	 * LFE; it is **not** a studio 5.1 that was mixed that
	 * way. Same count = no-op. More source channels than
	 * wanted = Fail (that is @ref Downmix).
	 *
	 * @par Do not stack
	 * Not with @ref Downmix on the same stretch. Before
	 * @ref Loudnorm. After @ref Resample is fine.
	 *
	 * @par Algorithm
	 * Try `surround` (chl_in from
	 * @ref FFmpeg::AVChannelLayout::Describe, LFE band
	 * when the target has LFE), then `aformat`, then
	 * `pan` with a folded LFE. Hardware N/A.
