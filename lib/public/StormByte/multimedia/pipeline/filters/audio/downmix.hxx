	 * is @ref Filter::FFmpeg::Fail — use @ref Upmix.
	 *
	 * @par Do not stack
	 * Not with @ref Upmix on the same stretch. After
	 * @ref Resample is fine; before @ref Loudnorm so the
	 * meter sees the delivered layout.
	 *
	 * @par LFE
	 * `aformat` first so a standard layout keeps LFE when
	 * the target has one. Fallback
	 * `pan=…|FL=FL+0.707*LFE|FR=FR+0.707*LFE` folds LFE
