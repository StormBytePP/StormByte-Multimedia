	 * Attach with @c job.Video(in).Filter<Cas>(log).
	 *
	 * @par What it is for
	 * Last-mile acutance after denoise, before the encode. Film,
	 * tape and web masters that look soft once grain is gone;
	 * not a restorer of detail that was never there. Put it
	 * after @ref Atadenoise / @ref Bm3d / @ref Fftdnoiz, not
	 * instead of them. Do not stack `unsharp` on the same
	 * stretch. Skip it on an already over-sharpened master.
	 *
	 * @par Algorithm
	 * AMD FidelityFX CAS. Each sample is sharpened against its
	 * 3×3 neighbourhood in proportion to local contrast: flat
	 * grain is almost untouched, edges pick up acutance. One
	 * frame in, one frame out. The graph owns the look; this
	 * leaf does not Hold.
	 *
	 * @par HDR
	 * Spatial only. Primaries, transfer, range, chroma siting
	 * and SAR of the source frame are copied onto the sink
	 * frame before @ref Filter::FFmpeg::Save. PQ / HLG
	 * metadata is not rewritten.
	 *
	 * @par Defaults
	 * Empty @a strength here is @c 0.4. FFmpeg’s own default
	 * is @c 0 (a no-op). Film after denoise rarely wants the
	 * FFmpeg 0.8 ceiling; 0.4 is the documented StormByte
	 * starting point. Range 0–1.
	 *
	 * @par Mutation
	 * @ref Filter::FFmpeg::Save of the buffersink frame.
	 * Hardware frames Fail. Non-video units are ignored.
	 *
