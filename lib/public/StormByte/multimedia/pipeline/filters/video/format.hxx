	 * @par What it is for
	 * Hand the encoder a layout it accepts: 10-bit → 8-bit

	 * not change; that is @ref Scale. Colour tags are copied,

	 *
	 * @par Do not stack
	 * One Format per tube unless two encodes need two
	 * layouts. Same format as the source is a no-op (no Save).
	 * @c AV_PIX_FMT_NONE Fails. Hardware frames Fail.
	 *
	 * @par Engine
	 * @ref FFmpeg::AVFrame::ScaleTo at source width/height.
	 * Packed RGB / @c VideoLayout::Unknown uses
	 * @c Scaler::Sws; planar YUV/gray uses @c Scaler::Zimg.
	 *
	 * @par Mutation
	 * @ref Filter::FFmpeg::Save of the converted frame.
