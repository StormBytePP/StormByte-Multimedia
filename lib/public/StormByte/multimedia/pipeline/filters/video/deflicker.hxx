	 * @class Deflicker
	 * @brief Temporal luminance smoother via libavfilter `deflicker`. Process leaf.
	 *
	 * @par Algorithm
	 * Measures mean luma of each picture and scales the whole
	 * frame so that luma tracks a moving average of the last
	 * @a size frames. Mode selects the average (`am` arithmetic,
	 * `gm` geometric, `hm` harmonic, `qm` quadratic, `cm` cubic,
	 * `pm` power, `median`). The graph owns the window; this
	 * leaf does not Hold.
	 *
	 * Early frames may not leave @c buffersink (`EAGAIN`).
	 * @ref Process then returns without @ref Filter::FFmpeg::Save.
	 * Drain the tail in @ref Eof via @c AVFilterGraph::Flush.
	 *
	 * @par What it is for
	 * Lamp flicker on film scans, exposure pumping, some
	 * compressed masters whose DC luma jumps frame to frame.
	 * It is not a denoise and not a deband. On a stable
	 * digital master it does almost nothing useful and can
	 * flatten intended fades if @a size is large.
	 *
	 * @par HDR
	 * A global luma gain. Primaries, transfer, range, chroma
	 * siting and SAR are copied onto the sink frame. PQ / HLG
	 * mastering metadata is not rewritten. Keep @a size modest
	 * on HDR so a fade-to-black is not “corrected”.
	 *
	 * @par Defaults
	 * Empty arguments: @c size=5, @c mode=am. Same as FFmpeg.
	 *
	 * @par Mutation
	 * @ref Filter::FFmpeg::Save of the buffersink frame.
	 * Hardware frames Fail. Non-video units are ignored.
