	/**
	 * @class Degrain
	 * @brief Two-pass, scene-aware film-grain reducer built on libavfilter
	 *        @c fftdnoiz. ProcessTwoPasses leaf. Not a wrapper and not a
	 *        copy of @ref Fftdnoiz.
	 *
	 * Attach with @c job.Video(in).Filter<Degrain>(log) or
	 * @c Filter<Degrain>(log, cap) to clamp the strongest stretch.
	 *
	 * @par What it is for
	 * Hollywood film grain that survived the remaster (roughly pre-2015:
	 * Harry Potter, similar 35 mm scans). One pass of @ref Fftdnoiz at
	 * a fixed sigma either leaves grain on walls / night or plastics
	 * faces. Degrain walks the picture once, scores every frame, splits
	 * the timeline into stretches, and only then picks a sigma per
	 * stretch. The second pass runs @c fftdnoiz with that map.
	 *
	 * Use it when you can see grain in mid-tones and crushed night, and
	 * you are willing to spend a full decode before encode. It is not
	 * a live filter and not a substitute for @ref Afftdn (audio) or
	 * @ref Deband (contouring).
	 *
	 * @par What it is not
	 * Not @ref Fftdnoiz with a different name. @ref Fftdnoiz is one
	 * sigma, one graph, every frame. Degrain owns the measure, the
	 * stretch vote and the skip path; @c fftdnoiz is only the engine
	 * on stretches that survived the vote. Do not document or sell
	 * this leaf as “fftdnoiz defaults”.
	 *
	 * @par When to attach
	 * After decode, before @ref Cas / @ref Scale / @ref Deband.
	 * After @ref Fieldmatch / @ref Decimate if the source was
	 * telecined. Do not put it on animation, screen content, or a
	 * master that is already clean — the night floor will still fire
	 * on dark flats.
	 *
	 * @par Do not stack
	 * Exclusive with @ref Fftdnoiz, @ref Bm3d, @ref NlMeans,
	 * @ref VagueDenoiser, @ref Hqdn3d and a temporal
	 * @ref Atadenoise. Two grain leaves on the same video is how
	 * faces turn to clay. @ref Deband after Degrain is fine
	 * (bands, not grain).
	 *
	 * @par Two passes
	 * @ref Measure copies a bounded YUV420P ring (5+1+5), scores the
	 * centre when neighbours exist, and stores one @ref Row per
	 * picture. @ref Eof of the measure pass calls @ref Decide, which
	 * cuts on mean/raw jumps and votes one @ref Segment per stretch.
	 * @ref Process of the encode pass looks the PTS up, builds or
	 * reuses an @ref FFmpeg::AVFilterGraph at that sigma, and
	 * @ref Filter::FFmpeg::Save. A stretch with @c skip or a
	 * failed vote is a no-op (no graph, no Save). Hardware frames
	 * are not converted here; ScaleTo failure drops that sample.
	 *
	 * @par Vote (contract)
	 * Night (@c mean ≤ NightMean) never skips and is at least
	 * SigmaNight — crushed blacks still hold grain. Flat walls with
	 * no live/skin signal follow raw, capped at SigmaWall. Motion
	 * or a close “alive” plane uses SigmaClose. Mixed alive+flat
	 * uses SigmaMix. Clean mid/bright with raw below CleanSigma
	 * skips. The caller @a cap is an extra ceiling, not a floor.
	 *
	 * @par Detectors
	 * @c fLive is a cheap band-pass + temporal hold, not a face
	 * network. @c fSkin is a Y/U/V box on 4:2:0 chroma. Both are
	 * auxiliary: a miss must not skip a night stretch. A future
	 * face library can replace those two numbers; the vote stays.
	 *
	 * @par Cost
	 * Measure is a full decode plus a small ring of YUV420P frames
	 * (max 11). The second pass is @c fftdnoiz with prev=next=1 —
	 * expensive on 4K because of the FFT, not because of two
	 * passes. RAM of the row table is a handful of doubles per
	 * frame; do not keep pictures after Decide.
	 *
	 * @par Failure
	 * No stable stretch → Warning and passthrough. Graph Ensure /
	 * Filter errors Fail the leaf. Uncertainty in auto detect is
	 * a skip, never a blind sigma.
	 *
