	 * @brief Spatial non-local means denoise. Process leaf.

	 *
	 * @par What it is for
	 * Moderate spatial grain when BM3D is too expensive and
	 * hqdn3d is too blunt. Cartoon / anime edges survive
	 * better than with a box blur. Still one frame, no
	 * temporal help. Not the first choice on 4K.
	 *
	 * @par Do not stack
	 * Exclusive with @ref Bm3d, @ref Fftdnoiz,
	 * @ref VagueDenoiser and @ref Hqdn3d.
	 *
	 * @par Algorithm
	 * One frame. Each sample is a similarity-weighted average
	 * of patches inside a search window. No Hold.
	 * Implemented on the frame, not via avfilter `nlmeans`.
	 *
	 * @par Defaults
	 * Empty arguments pick a profile from the first video frame:
	 * - 4K+: research=2, patch=1, strength=0.8
	 * - below: research=3, patch=2, strength=1.0
	 * Caller values are used as-is.
	 *
	 * @par Mutation

	 * @ref StormByte::Multimedia::FFmpeg::AVFrame.
