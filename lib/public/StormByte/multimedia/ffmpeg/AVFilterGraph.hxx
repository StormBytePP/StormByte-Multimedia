	 * @par Video
	 * Builds @c buffer → &lt;graph&gt; → @c buffersink. @p graph is an
	 * avfilter filterchain (e.g. @c "cas=strength=0.4"). One input
	 * pad only; filters that need a @c ref pad fail @ref Open.
	 *
	 * @par Audio
	 * Builds @c abuffer → &lt;graph&gt; → @c abuffersink. The model
	 * frame must have sample rate, sample format and a channel
	 * layout (@ref AVFrame::SampleRate, @ref AVFrame::Format,
	 * @ref AVFrame::ChannelLayout). Same one-pad rule.
	 *
	 * @par Selection
	 * @ref Open treats a frame with width and height &gt; 0 as
	 * video. Otherwise a frame with sample rate and channel count
	 * &gt; 0 is audio. Hardware video frames fail. Do not mix
	 * media on a reused wrapper: @ref Ensure rebuilds.
	 *
	 * Reuse the same wrapper across frames of the same geometry
	 * (video: size+format; audio: rate+format+layout) and chain
	 * via @ref Ensure. Do not call av_*.
